## Why should we run?

Humans are endurance (aerobic) animals that evolved in a calorie-deficient environment with low-level but prolonged daily activity. Wearing ill-fitting shoes, sitting at desks all day long and then attempting to balance this with the latest fad of high intensity fitness programs, leads to a wide range of problems. Reverse the 'Diseases of Civilisation' and fulfill your evolutionary role: to walk and run efficiently, on demand and without injury, throughout your lifetime.
